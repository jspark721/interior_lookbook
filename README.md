- Designed with Sketch
- Interior Lookbook is a web app in progress

### Future options to be implemented
- Image uploading
- Image tagging by different rooms (bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, dining room, etc)
- Image tagging by different styles (modern, classic, contemporary, chic, minimalist, etc)
- Image tagging by different colors (white, neutral, pink, blue, green, gray, etc.)
- Users can save images to their own lookbook (favorites)
